#String to Image Converter
This Python script converts a given string into binary format and saves it as a monochrome image using the Python Imaging Library (PIL). It could be useful for simple data encoding or image manipulation projects.

#How to Use
Make sure you have PIL installed. You can install it using pip: pip install Pillow

Save the input string in a text file named 'data.txt'

Run the script. The output image will be saved as 'output_image.png' in the same directory as the script.

#How it Works
The script reads the input string from 'data.txt' and converts it to binary format using ASCII encoding.

The binary data is converted into a list of pixels, with each pixel represented as a list of eight bits.

The script creates a new monochrome image with the dimensions 8xlen(pixels), where len(pixels) is the number of rows needed to represent all the bits.

The image is saved as a PNG file with the name 'output_image.png'.

#Customization
You can customize the script to suit your needs by modifying the input file name, the output file name, or the image dimensions. You could also modify the code to include error handling, support different image formats, or use different encoding schemes.

#Dependencies
Python 3.x
Pillow (Python Imaging Library)
